*It is rare when one can indulge in one's prejudices with relative impunity, poking a bit of good humored fun to make a point.*


With this statement, Carl Helmers opened his remarks in the "About the Cover" section of the August 1978 issue of BYTE. The issue was a special on the language Pascal, so Helmers took the opportunity to present Pascal's triangle as drawn by artist Robert Tinney. The primary allegory of the cover was the inversion of the Bermuda Triangle myth to show smooth waters within the area labeled "Pascal's Triangle." In explaining the allegory, Helmers guided the traveler through the FORTRAN Ocean, the BASIC Sea, around the Isle of BAL, and up to the Land of Smalltalk.

*Traveling upward (in the picture) through heavy seas we come to the pinnacle, a snow white island rising like an ivory tower out of the surrounding shark infested waters. Here we find the fantastic kingdom of Smalltalk, where great and magical things happen. But alas . . . the craggy aloofness of the kingdom of Smalltalk keeps it out of the mainstream of things.*

It is rare when one can indulge in one's fantasies to respond to so pointed a remark as that provided by the then editor of BYTE. This month's cover design presents Njust such an opportunity. It depicts the clouds clearing from around the kingdom of Smalltalk, and, with banners streaming, the Smalltalk system is taking flight into the mainstream of the computer programming community. This cover was also executed by Robert Tinney, to the delight of the Learning Research Group (LRG) of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. LRG is the group that has designed, implemented, and evaluated several generations of Smalltalk over the past ten years.

The balloon on the cover symbolizes the Small talk-80 system that is being released this year for more general access. The release is in the form of publications and a file containing the Smalltalk-80 programming system. Twelve articles describing the system appear in this issue of BYTE. Through such publication, LRG's research will become generally accessible, dispelling the clouds.

Smalltalk is the name LRG assigned to the software part of Alan Kay's personal computing vision, the Dynabook. The vision is a hand-held, high-performance computer with a high-resolution display, input and output devices supporting visual and audio communication paths, and network connections to shared information resources. LRG's goal is to support an individual's ability to use the Dynabook creatively. This requires an understanding of the interactions among language, knowledge, and communication. To this end, LRG does research on the design and implementation of programming languages, programming systems, data bases, virtual memories, and user interfaces.

The ivory tower on the island of Smalltalk is an exciting, creative place in which to work on these ideas. A sense of LRG's long-range goals is aptly portrayed in the illustrations designed by Ted Kaehler.

In figure 1, we see a view of the conventional software development environment: a wizard sitting on his own computational cloud creating his notion of a Taj Mahal in which programmers can indulge in building applications for nonprogramming users. The Taj Mahal represents a complete programming environment, which includes the tools for developing programs as well as the language in which the programs are written. The users must walk whatever bridge the programmer builds.

A goal in the design of the Smalltalk system was to create the Taj Mahal so that programmers can modify it by building application kits, which are specialized extensions and/or subsets of the system whose parts can be used by a nonprogrammer to build a customized version of the application. Applications that can be created from a kit are related in a fundamental way: the programmer may, for example, create it for building bridges, but it is the user who pieces together the parts to create a customized bridge (see figure 2).

One of LRG's current research goals is to provide system parts to aid the programmer in creating kits. Although Smalltalk itself is conceptually sufficient for this task, it needs better support to help the programmer piece together the graphical display and the control for an interactive user interface. This is the "kit maker," as shown in figure 3.

As part of the Dynabook vision, the system should help the programmer build a personal computational cloud (see figure 4). Two research projects, ThingLab by Alan Borning and PIE by Ira Goldstein and Danny Bobrow, took advantage of Smalltalk's support for creating new metaphors.

We are often asked: "What makes Smalltalk different from other languages?" The articles in this issue attempt to answer that question. Look for an emphasis on interactive graphics, on modular development of programs, and on integrated approaches to accessing program development tools. Also, look for the distinction between a programming language and a programming system, and consider the difference in providing a system in which the user can feel individual mastery over complexity. Although each article can be read independently of the
