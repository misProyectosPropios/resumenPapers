## Intent

Provide a surrogate for another object that shares the same interface but does nothing. The Null Object encapsulates the implementation decisions of how to “do nothing” and hides those details from its collaborators

A class requires a collaborator that does nothing. It should be treated as the ones that does something.

## Example

Model View Controller (MVC). If they are read-only
