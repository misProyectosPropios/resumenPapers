Its a paper about the release of Smalltalk-80

The ballon of the cover:
+ Its the Smalltalk-80 system, for more general access

Release is in the form of publication and a file that contais the programming system.
+ 12 articles describes the system appearence.
+ They are the ones that dispells the clouds.

Smalltalk: software part of Alan Kay's personal computing vision.

+ Vision: hand-held high-performance computer with high resolution
+ It's objective its to support individual creativity.
	+ Understanding of interction: language, knowledge and communication
+ Research: on the desing and implementation of programming languages, data bases, virtual memories and user interfaces
+ It's an exciting, creative place to work on these ideas.

It uses the metaphor of the programmer as a wizard that creates, in the example taj mahal. The user walk whatever bridge between where they are and the taj mahal

+ It should be very modifiable, so programmers build _application kits_


+ The system should help the programmer build a personal computational cloud

## What makes Smalltalk special

We are often asked: "What makes Smalltalk different from other languages?" The articles in this issue attempt to answer that question. Look for an emphasis on interactive graphics, on modular development of programs, and on integrated approaches to accessing program development tools. Also, look for the distinction between a programming language and a programming system, and consider the difference in providing a system in which the user can feel individual mastery over complexity.

others, knowledge of the Smalltalk-80 system and its design philosophy is a prerequisite to understanding many of them. The map in figure 5 is presented to help the reader find a course through this hitherto uncharted ivory tower.
